# PROJECT YETI 
Project Yeti is a WordPress starter theme based on Zurb Foundation 6. Due to the fact this is a starter theme it is considered ideal for website designers and developers, if you want a full polished theme then this is not for you.
Currently [Foundation 6 is in prototype](http://zurb.com/article/1403/foundation-6-prototype-to-production) and therefore should be considered a BETA, and errors should be expected to say the least. 

Please beware that this WordPress template is Licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE and Foundation 6 by ZURB is licensed under the MIT license, you are welcome to fork, copy, modify, delete, share and even sell for profit but do ensure you keep the original licenses intact. 

I welcome any quality contributions to this project and I hope we can make Project Yeti a winning success story for providing a lightweight WordPress starter theme based on Foundation.
