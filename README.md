## A ZURB Foundation 6 WordPress Starter Theme
Project Yeti is a WordPress starter theme based on Zurb Foundation 6. Due to the fact this is a starter theme it is considered ideal for website designers and developers, if you want a full polished theme then this is not for you.
Currently [Foundation 6 is in prototype](http://zurb.com/article/1403/foundation-6-prototype-to-production) and therefore should be considered a BETA, and errors should be expected to say the least.
